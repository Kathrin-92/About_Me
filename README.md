## Hi there!

- :briefcase: I used to be a Senior PR manager working in a content-marketing-agency in Hamburg. 
- :mortar_board: Until I decided that I would like to try something new: since 2021 I'm studying Data Science at iubh university! 
- :rocket: I've completed the first year of study to learn all the necessary basics - from statistics and maths, to Database Modeling, SQL and Python.
- :tada: Next on my list: Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Visualization & Business Intelligence.  
- ðŸ’¬ Please feel free to reach out to me! As a senior communications consultant and data science major, I am looking for new challenges in data analytics, data science and digital marketing.
