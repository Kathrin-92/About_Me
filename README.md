## Hi there!

- :briefcase: I used to be a Senior PR manager working in a content-marketing-agency in Hamburg. 
- :mortar_board: Until I decided that I would like to try something new: since 2021 I'm studying Data Science at iubh university! 
- :rocket: I've completed two years of study to learn all the necessary basics - from statistics and maths, to Database Modeling, SQL and Python, Data Analysis and Visualization & Business Intelligence.
- :tada: Currently on my list: Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning.
